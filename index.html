      excellence throughout each day and follow and enforce all health, safety and
      hygiene</li>
    <li>Keeping track of all the different packet labels for each order was very
      important as we would use them to back trace the product to the source using the
      batch codes</li>
    <li>During the day I have lots of different orders coming through to me at one
      time, which has helped improve my time management and problem solving skills
      along the way</li>
    <li>I've had to change our operating procedures a few times due to new machinery
      or software updates, which I quickly adapted to whilst keeping production going
      in an efficient manner</li>
    <li>Prior to being the assistant supervisor I would put forward lots of ways
      things could be done differently to help improve production</li>
    <li>Proper planning, preparation and trust in my team meant it also gave me the
      chance to help in other areas of the factory and improve my knowledge of the
      whole process of the company</li>
